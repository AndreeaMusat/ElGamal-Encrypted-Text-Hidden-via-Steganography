William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover 
originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning 
farmer.[14] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His 
actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's
Day.[15] This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has 
proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616.[16][17] He 
was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.[18]
