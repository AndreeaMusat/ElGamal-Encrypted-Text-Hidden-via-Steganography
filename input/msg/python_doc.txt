As an example of subclassing, the random module provides the WichmannHill class that 
implements an alternative generator in pure Python. The class provides a backward 
compatible way to reproduce results from earlier versions of Python, which used 
the Wichmann-Hill algorithm as the core generator. Note that this Wichmann-Hill generator
can no longer be recommended: its period is too short by contemporary standards, and the
sequence generated is known to fail some stringent randomness tests. See the references
below for a recent variant that repairs these flaws.
